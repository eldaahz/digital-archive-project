##Descritpion 
We are building an archive management system for cataloging, searching, and managing digital art collections. The system integrates Dublin Core metadata standards with an object-oriented design to support multiple archive formats. This project begins with a function library of 15+ reusable utilities that form the foundation of future OOP development. These functions will handle metadata validation, file parsing, identifier generation, search functionality, and other tasks essential for managing digital art archives.
