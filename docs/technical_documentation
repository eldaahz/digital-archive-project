Key Design Decisions
1. Dublin Core Metadata
Decision: Use Dublin Core 15-element standard for artwork metadata.
Why: Industry standard for archives; interoperable; comprehensive for art collections.
Key Fields: title, creator, date, type, format, subject, description, rights

2. File Format Support
Decision: Support JPG, PNG, TIFF only.
Why - 
JPG: web standard, small files
PNG: lossless, transparency
TIFF: archival quality

Store file paths, not actual images (efficiency).

3. Tag-Based Organization
Decision: Flexible tagging separate from Dublin Core subjects.
Why: Users need informal grouping; supports custom organizational schemes

4. Custom Error Handling
Decision: Exception hierarchy - ValidationError, PermissionError, StorageError.
Why: Clear error messages; maintains data integrity; different failures need different handling.

Data Validation
Dublin Core Requirements:

Title, creator, date, type, format (required)
Date: ISO format (YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYY-MM-DD)
Type: Controlled vocabulary (Painting, Sculpture, etc.)
File formats: JPG/JPEG/PNG/TIFF/TIF only
